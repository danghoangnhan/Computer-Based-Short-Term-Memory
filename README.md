[![Build Status](https://github.com/danghoangnhan/Computer-Based-Short-Term-Memory/actions/workflows/linux-android.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/danghoangnhan/Computer-Based-Short-Term-Memory/actions/workflows/android.yml)

## Overview

This project implements the CB-STM (Computer-Based Short-Term Memory) test, as proposed in the research paper "[Development of a Rapid Screening Tool for Mild Cognitive Impairment: Validation of a Computer-Based Short-Term Memory Test](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Development-of-a-Rapid-Screening-Tool-for-Mild-of-a-Yip-Chen/179e50de6f610f9669064fbf57832a6f9915bc20)." The CB-STM test is designed to assess short-term memory capabilities in individuals and may serve as a screening tool for mild cognitive impairment.

## Device Requirements

The CB-STM test is developed for Android devices. The following device specifications are recommended:

- Operating System: Android
- Screen Size: 5.7-inch
- Device Type: Samsung Galaxy S6 (Alternative devices with the same OS and screen size may be used for testing)

## Getting Started

To get started with the CB-STM test, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build the project and ensure there are no errors.
4. Connect your Samsung Galaxy S6 or an alternative device meeting the specified requirements for testing.



## Testing and Validation

Testing and validation of the CB-STM test are crucial to ensure its accuracy and usability. The application should be thoroughly tested on the Samsung Galaxy S6 or alternative devices with the specified screen size and operating system.

Additionally, data may be collected from users to validate the test's effectiveness as a screening tool for mild cognitive impairment. Any data collection should be done following ethical guidelines, and user consent should be obtained.
